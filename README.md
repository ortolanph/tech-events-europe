## How to contribute

If you want to contribute, fork this repository and do the changes to the `events_XX.json` file for your country, where `XX` is the country code with two letters. 

Then create a pull request for it. Once approved I will run a python script that will create all the pages and update this repository.

But if you want to interact with me more often, create an issue with the following labes:

|      Labels      | Meaning                                                  |
|:----------------:|----------------------------------------------------------|
|      `BUG`       | Something is wrong, and needs to be fixed                | 
|  `Help Needed`   | When the project needs something and someone can attend. |
|   `Suggestion`   | A suggestion to make things better                       |
|      `Team`      | When someone wants to contribute by adding events        |
| `Update Request` | When is needed to make a update before                   |

Create an issue with the `Team` tag to be responsible for the events in your country.
