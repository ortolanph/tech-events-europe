# Technology Events @Europe

Events of technology all over the Europe.

## Contents

This repository is under construction. Still no content... I will make my efforts to create the parsing script for 2025. But you can begin contributing. See how below.

* [Portugal](pages/events_pt.md)

## Test Countries

Just to have a little fun and see how things are:

* [Arctavia](pages/events_ac.md)
* [Solarya](pages/events_so.md)
* [Veridonia](pages/events_vd.md)
* [Zorenthia](pages/events_zt.md)
* [Lunovia](pages/events_lu.md)

## How to use it?

On the Contents table select your country and you will be redirected into the country event page. This page is updated weekly to show only the remaining months of the year.

## How to contribute

If you want to contribute, fork this repository and do the changes to the events.json file for your country. Then create a pull request for it. Once approved I will run a python script that will create all the pages and update this repository.

Create an issue with the `Team` tag to be responsible for the events in your country.

Thanks, Paulo Ortolan.
